**VirusTotal Hash Information Retrieval**
This Python script interacts with the VirusTotal API to retrieve information about hash values. It allows you to input hash values from user and obtain their corresponding MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 values, if available in the VirusTotal database.

**Usage Instructions**
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: Python Downloads

Install the required requests library using the following command:
Copy code
pip install requests
Replace 'YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY' in the code with your actual VirusTotal API key. You can obtain the API key by signing up for a VirusTotal account.

Save the code in a .py file (e.g., hash_info_retrieval.py).

Create a text file containing the hash values you want to retrieve information for. Each hash value should be on a separate line.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the .py file is located.

Run the script using the command:

Copy code
python hash_info_retrieval.py
Follow the prompts to provide the path to the input text file and the output text file.

The script will process each hash value, retrieve information from VirusTotal, and save the results to the output text file.
